1) What is the CAP theorem? Differentiate between forward proxy and reverse proxy. 

Ans:    CAP theorem is also known as Brewer's theorem.
        CAP stands for 
            C: consistency
                Consistency means that all clients see the same data at the same time, no matter which node they connect to.

            A: Availability
                Availability means that that any client making a request for data gets a response, even if one or more nodes are down.

            P: partition tolerance
                A partition is a communications break within a distributed systemâ€”a lost or temporarily delayed connection between two nodes.

        A distributed system is a network that stores data on more than one node at the same time.

        Forward proxy is used by the client 
        Reverse proxy is used by the server


2) What is Caching and what are the different types of cache. What are the different ways to update cache?

Ans:    Caching is the process of storing data in a cache. A cache is a temporary storage area. It saves the logs each and everytime.

        Types of cache: 
            1. Web Caching 
            2. Data Cachin
            3. Application/Output Caching
            4. Distributed Caching

        
3) Differentiate between RPC and REST.

Ans:    RPC-based APIs are great for actions eg. commands. 
        REST-based APIs are great for modeling your domain eg. resources, 
        making CRUD (create, read, update, delete) available for all of your data.
